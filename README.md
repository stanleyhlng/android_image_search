Image Search Android App

## Overview

Build a Google Image Search app which allows a user to search images.  In this app, user can modify advanced search options and result pagination.

## User Stories

* User can enter a search query that will display a grid of images from Google Images.
* User can modify advanced search options such as:
   * Size (small, medium, large, extra-large)
   * Color filter (black, blue, brown, gray, green, etc...)
   * Type (faces, photo, clip art, line art)
   * Site (espn.com)
   * Subsequent searches will have these filters applied to the results
* User should be able to load more images by paginating with a button to "Load More"
* User clicks a “Load More” button in the footer of the GridView
* Optional: User can instead scroll “infinitely” to load more image results

## Learning 
* Explore starting activities with intents that contain user data.
* Explore returning a result when an activity is finished.
* Explore asynchronously loading images.
* Optional: Implementing a common mobile feature of loading new data via scrolling.
